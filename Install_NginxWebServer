We’ll show you how to use the Ansible automation tool to install the nginx web server on a Ubuntu machine in this post.

Step 1: Creating Nginx Playbook
We need to create a nginx-playbook.yml, Ansible play is very import to to execute the task one by one.

        - restart nginx

  handlers:
    - name: restart nginx
